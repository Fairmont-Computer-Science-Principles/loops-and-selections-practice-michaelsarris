#Students need to use a selection statement and 2 loops in order to complete this activity. 
#Students will receive basic python code and they will piece together the solution. If a student cannot complete this activity they should provide pseudocode of what they imagine the solution to be. 
#--------write your code below ----- #

stars = "**"
stars += "**" # will add two star characters into stars 
x = 0 
python function string[start:end]

if (x<5):
  print(stars)
  #for loop
